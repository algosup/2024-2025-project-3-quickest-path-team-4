# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

## Week 2 Objectives

1. **Functional specifications**
 - We wanted to complete the functional specifications document.
2. **Direction**
 - We wanted to finish deciding what the team should work on moving forward, meaning what algorithm we should use and how we should implement it.
3. **Code**
 - We wanted to start working on the code early.

## Team Morale
Here is a graph representing the team's satisfaction for the second week. (I am waiting for Ian's input before putting the image)

## Project advancements

1. **Functional specifications**
 - The functional specifications are not finished.
2. **Direction**
 - After thoroughly examining the call for tender, we realized that we are allowed to do a huge amount of preprocessing. Preprocessing would make the project significantly easier. Even though the team really dislikes preprocessing, it is a required step if we want to complete the project on time while still following the call for tender.
3. **Code**
 - We have some code that we were able to test.

## Challenges

1. **Absences**
 - Our Software engineer was absent for 1/3 of the project time, thus dragging the morale team's morale down.
2. **Realization**
 - As stated during the [Project advancements](#project-advancements), the team spent a while choosing how to go forward. The final decision did not make everyone happy.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Techincal Specifications**
 - We aim to finalize the Technical Specifications promptly so the technical leader can resume assisting the team with coding.
2. **Finish the algorithm**
 - Before the end of next week, it is imperative that we finish a working version of the algorithm with, which would allow us to complete the REST API.

## Conclusion

The team's morale went down after realizing just how difficult finding a result in under a second would be. We have decided how to move forward.
