# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

## Week 2 Objectives

1. **Functional specifications**
 - We wanted to complete the functional specifications document.
2. **Direction**
 - We wanted to finish deciding what the team should work on moving forward, meaning what algorithm we should use and how we should implement it.
3. **Code**
 - We wanted to start working on the code early.

## Team Morale
Here is a graph representing the team's satisfaction for the second week. (I am waiting for Ian's input before putting the image)

## Project advancements

1. **Functional specifications**
 - The functional specifications are not finished.
2. **Direction**
 - After thoroughly examining the call for tender, we realized that we are allowed to do a huge amount of preprocessing. Preprocessing would make the project significantly easier. After a group meeting, we decided to try to make the preprocessing version of the algorithm work and then try to complete the Dijkstra version. Even though the team really dislikes the preprocessing solution, it is better to be safe than sorry.
3. **Code**
 - We have some code that we were able to test.

## Challenges

1. **Absences**
 - Our Software engineer was absent for 1/3 of the project time, thus dragging the morale team's morale down.
2. **Realization**
 - As stated during the [Project advancements](#project-advancements), the team spent a while choosing how to go forward. The final decision did not make everyone happy.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Techincal Specifications**
 - We aim to finalize the Technical Specifications promptly so the technical leader can resume assisting the team with coding.
2. **Finish the preprocessing version of the algorithm**
 - Before the end of next week, it is imperative that we finish the preprocessing version of the algorithm, which would allow us to complete the REST API and start working on the version of the algorithm that we want in the long run.

## Conclusion

The team's morale went down after realizing just how difficult finding a result in under a second would be. We have decided how to move forward.
