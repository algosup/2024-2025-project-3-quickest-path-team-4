# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

## Week 3 Objectives

1. **Techincal Specifications**
 - We wanted to complete the technical specifications document.
2. **Finish the algorithm**
 - We wanted to finish the algorithm to allow the team to finish the REST API.

## Team Morale
Here is a graph representing the team's satisfaction for the second week. (I am waiting for Ian's input before putting the image)

## Project advancements

1. **Techincal Specifications**
 - The technical specifications are nearly finished.
2. **Finish the algorithm**
 - We have not been able to finish the algorithm as the software engineer was yet again not here. The software engineer has written no lines of code since the beginning of the project, which is angering the team.

## Challenges

1. **Absences**
 - The team's morale hit an all-time low on Wednesday when the software engineer, who had left on Monday morning, returned to tell us he would not be there for the rest of the week and left again.
2. **Code**
 - The software engineer has not written any code. All the code we do have was written by other members. We are lagging as we need to take care of our documents. The team is fed up.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Techincal Specifications**
 - We aim to finalize the Technical Specifications.
2. **Advancing on the code**
 - Since some documents are completed, we could try to focus on writing more of the code.
3. **Talking to our superiors about the software engineer's absence**
 - The software engineer told us he would be back next week. If he isn't back by the break on Monday, the team will talk to Franck.

## Conclusion

The team's morale is extremely low due to the absence and lack of work of the software engineer. The documents are moving along. The code is seriously lacking.
