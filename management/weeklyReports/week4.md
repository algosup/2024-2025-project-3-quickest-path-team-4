# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

## Week 4 Objectives

1. **Complete Techincal Specifications**
 - We wanted to finalize the Technical Specifications.
2. **Advancing on the code**
 - Since some documents had been completed, we wanted to focus on writing more of the code.
3. **Talking to our superiors about the software engineer's absence**
 - The team wanted to talk to Franck about the software engineer's absence.

## Team Morale
Here is a graph representing the team's satisfaction for the fourth week. <br>


## Project advancements

1. **Complete Techincal Specifications**
 - We were hoping to finish the Technical Specifications, however, we realized that there are still many different parts of the algorithms that will require changes in the document. It will be completed on Thursday or Friday of next week.
2. **Advancing on the code**
 - We managed to advance a lot on the code. Nearly all of the team worked on the code for this week. Not everyone could work on the algorithm at the same time, which meant some of us had to work on the server. It can receive a GET request, run the algorithm, and return results in XML or JSON format. The algorithm was also considerably improved, with the response for the longest path going down from 37 seconds to 13 seconds.
3. **Talking to our superiors about the software engineer's absence**
 - We went to talk to Franck, and he said that we should transform either the technical writer or the program manager into a software engineer. But before the team could decide who would become a software engineer. Ian came back and did some work, so we didn't think it necessary anymore to have someone take his role over. However, if the same thing were to happen for another project, I would make another group member a software engineer at the start of the project.

## Challenges

1. **Morale recovery**
 - The team's morale was very low at the end of the third week. The team needed time to reset mentally.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the code**
 - We need to finish the algorithm.
2. **Finishing the technical specifications**
 - Once the algorithm is complete, we need to finish the technical specifications.

## Conclusion

The deadline is approaching, and we have not finished just yet. We need to optimize the algorithm further to reach the desired outcome of a response under 1 second.
