2. **Finishing the technical specifications**
 - The technical specifications have been finished in accordance to the new algorithm.

## Challenges

1. **Morale recovery**

2. **Absences**
 - The Technical Writer was absent on the last two days, the Program Manager was absent on thursday and the Software engineer was absent on the first two days.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Work on the presentation**
 - We need to prepare our presentation for next friday.
2. **Tying up loose ends**
 - We need to clean up a few parts of the code.

## Conclusion

We managed to finish the project, the API returns a response within the desired timeframe of under a second. All we need now is to work on the pitch.
