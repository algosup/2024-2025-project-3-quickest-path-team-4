## Introduction

This document aims to summarize all the takeaways from our project. It highlights areas where the team succeeded, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements for future projects, from both personal and team perspectives.

## Key Achievements

- The algorithms works in under one second for mac.
- The final presentation did have some issues with the story-telling but we were told afterwards that it was very clear.
- GitHub organization was clear and efficient apart from a few pushes in main.
- Even with the high number of absences and the numerous setbacks, the team's mood was always quite good and everyone endend the project happily.
- Everyone in the team try to involve themselves in their own way, thus helping group cohesion and morale.

## Challenges

- We took a while to choose the right algorithm and, even now, we are not sure we made the right choice.
- We also took a very long time finding how to oprimise the algorithm.
- We were confronted to a lot of compatibility issues between windows and macOS, notably with Clang and WinSock.
- Respecting deadlines and managing time effectively were consistent challenges throughout the project.

## Root Causes

- We did not have any experience with algorithms and looked in all the wrong places.
- We severly underestimated how much optimisation we would need to achieve the requirement of under a second.
- We developped on Windows at first and then mostly on macOS. We also mostly used compilers optimised for macOS as we started focusing on optimisation when we switched to macOS.
- All of us severyle underestimated how daunting the project would be at first, leading to tardiness on the first document which led to a domino effect, hindering everyone.

## Lessons Learnt

- It is important to know how and where to do research, it is also good to ask questions to the client and the teacher.
- We also should not underestimate how difficult a project is going to be, we need to be ready for challenges at all times.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for everyone, the team meshed well together and we ended up with something that was nearly complete. We hope to work with each other again in the near future.
