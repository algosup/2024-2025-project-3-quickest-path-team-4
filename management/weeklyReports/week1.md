# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week was the first week of the project so the team mostly focused on figuring out what algorithm to use and how, as well as verifying the data. This weekly report will cover this weeks objectives, a report on the teams morale, our advancements on the objectives and any extras the team has done, the challenges the team has faced and our plan for next week.

## Week 1 Objectives

1. **Data verification**
    - We wanted to verify the data we were given to be sure that it did not have any extra or isolated paths and not cycles.
2. **Algorithm choice**
    - We wanted to choose what algorithm we were going to base our work.
3. **Funcional specification**
    - We wanted to have a skeleton for the document and for it to start to be filled.
4. **Planning/Deadlines**
    - Since there are no fixed deadlines for the project, we wanted to set deadlines for ourselves so as to not end up doing everything at the last minute. We also wanted a planning to know what to focus on.

## Team morale

## Project advancements

1. **Data verification**
    - We have verified the data and are there are not extra or isolated paths and no cycles.
2. **Algorithm choice**
    - We narrowed down the algorithm we want to use to a few choices but still have not been able to come to an agreement.
3. **Funcional specification**
    - We have a skeleton but it has not been filled enough.
4. **Planning/Deadlines**
    - We have fixed deadlines and created a schedule to ensure good coordination in the team using a Gantt Chart for deadlines and a RACI matrix for responsibility.

## Extras

1. **REST API**
    - To avoid burnout from just working on algorithms for days on end, some members of the team looked at REST APIs and thanks to that, we have already hosted a server and a skeleton for the REST API. However, we know that we cannot move forward with it until the algorithm is done. Therefore we will now fully focus on the algorithm before pursuing the REST API.

## Challenges

1. **Absences**
   - Our Software engineer was absent for the whole first week and our program manager was absent 3/5 of the time due to no fault of their own, which caused morale issues for the team which were quickly resolved.
2. **Learning about algorithms and C++**
   - C++ is a very common language but some of the team members have never used it before, so we need to take time to learn it. Most of the team also didn't know about the different time of algorithms so it took a lot of research to find the algorithms we could use.
3. **Rejection**
   - Our team tried to solve the problem by organising the data in a different way which woulf have allowed us to go through it much more easily. However we were told we were not allowed to tamper with the data. This caused us to lose a lot of time and hurt our morale a bit as we had worked on that solution for a while.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Functional Specifications**
   - We want to finish the Functional Specifications quickly, to allow some other documents to be worked on.
2. **Finish choosing an algorithm**
    - Before the end of this week, no matter what we will have chosen an algorithm to allow us to get to work.
3. **Start working on the code**
    - We need to start working on the code a bit to allow us to do extensive testing so as to avoid issues.

## Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. Even with the absences, our team is sure to stay strong until the end of the project which makes us all optimistic.
