## Tasks & schedule

You can view the breakdown of all the tasks the team has identified and will be doing by going to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CwzIMlFXa4_e0lZcfqYYREnHONU2Ed1wMpm5CHMeARk/edit?usp=sharing).

The tasks and schedule have been written down in Google Sheets, ensuring a good comprehension as it is a modular tool, which can implement metrics. Consequently, the client can track with ease the challenges and achievements done during the project.

## RACI Matrix

The RACI matrix of this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vy4L9r8V3n6dAgAR7JzQ41-nfrjRHLCymahQHND4CFs/edit?usp=sharing) considering the [Project Charter](./project_charter.md)

## Key Performance Indicators

### Definition of our KPIs

To enable the team and the client to track our project's milestones and progress. We have defined several quantitatively measurable KPIs. Below is a list of these KPIs along with their respective calculations.

#### Documents

The following KPIs are included in this section:

- **Functional specifications**
- **Technical specifications**
- **Test Plan**
- **User Manual**

The progress of these documents is measured using the following formula:

$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{\text{current number of sections}} {\text{total number of sections}})\times{100}$$

Where:

- **current_number_of_sections**: The number of sections that are finished.
- **total_number_of_sections**: The number of predefined sections in the document's outline, which may evolve.

#### Development

This section tracks the following KPIs:

- **Algorithm design/choice**
- **Algorithm optimization**
- **Web Server prepping and hosting**

Given the complexity and time required for development, we include progress on partially completed features. The progress is calculated using:

$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{({\text{current number of fully coded pages + sum percentages unfinished pages}})} {\text{total designed pages}})\times{100}$$

Where:

- **current_number_of_fully_coded_pages**: The number of pages that are fully completed.
- **sum_unfinished_pages_advancements**: The cumulative progress of each unfinished page, with progress for each page ranging from 0 to 1.
- **total_designed_pages**: The total number of pages defined during project analysis and design.

#### Design

This section covers the design for the web server, it is optional but would be nice to have. The KPIs in this section include:

- **Graphical Chart**
- **Designed Web Server**

The percentage progress for these KPIs is calculated using this formula:

$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{\text{(current number of graphical chart pages completed + number of pages for the design code)}} {\text{total number of pages to design/write}})\times{100}$$

Where:

- **current number of graphical chart pages completed**: The number of pages in the graphical chart that have been prototyped.
- **number of pages for the design code**: The number of code pages that have been written specifically used for the design of the website.
- **total_number_of_pages_to_design**: The total number of pages planned to be designed during the project analysis.

#### Mood

The mood percentage is calculated by averaging the weekly grades out of 10 given by each team member. These grades reflect their overall motivation and well-being from a personal perspective, as well as considering the project's milestones and challenges.

By utilizing these formulas, we ensure that our progress tracking is clear and consistent, and provides a realistic view of our project's status to the client. For readibility and a better understanding, the KPIs are rounded to the nearest 5%
