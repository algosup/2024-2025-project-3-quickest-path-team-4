# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week was the first week of the project, which means the team mostly focused on figuring out what algorithm to use and how, as well as verifying the data. This weekly report will cover this week's objectives, a report on the team's morale, our advancements on the objectives and any extras the team has done, the challenges the team has faced, and our plan for next week.

## Week 1 Objectives

1. **Data verification**
 - We wanted to verify the dataset to confirm the absence of extra or isolated paths and cycles.
2. **Algorithm choice**
 - We wanted to choose what algorithm we would base our work on.
3. **Funcional specification**
 - We wanted a skeleton for the document to allow the Program manager to start adding content.
4. **Planning/Deadlines**
 - Since there are no fixed deadlines for the project, we wanted to set deadlines for ourselves so as not to end up doing everything at the last minute. We also wanted a plan to know what to focus on.

## Project advancements

1. **Data verification**
 - We have verified the data. There are no extra or isolated paths and no cycles.
2. **Algorithm choice**
 - We narrowed down the algorithm we want to use to a few choices but still have not been able to come to an agreement.
3. **Funcional specification**
 - We have a skeleton for the document. However, the document does not have the expected amount of content.
4. **Planning/Deadlines**
 - We have fixed deadlines and created a schedule to ensure good coordination in the team using a Gantt Chart for deadlines and a RACI matrix for responsibility.

## Extras

1. **REST API**
 - To avoid burnout from only working on algorithms for days on end, some team members looked into REST APIs. Thanks to that, we have already hosted a server and a skeleton for our REST API. However, we know we cannot move forward until we have completed the algorithm. Therefore, we will fully focus on the algorithm before pursuing the REST API.

## Challenges

1. **Absences**
 - Our Software engineer was absent for the whole first week, and our program manager was absent 3/5 of the time due to no fault of their own, which caused morale issues for the team.
2. **Learning about algorithms and C++**
 - C++ is a common language, but some team members have never used it before, so we need to learn it. Most of the team also didn't know about the different types of algorithms, so we had to spend a lot of time researching algorithms to find one we could use.
3. **Rejection**
 - Our team tried to solve the problem by reorganizing the data, allowing us to go through it more easily. However, we were chastised for tampering with the data. This meant our previous work had been wasted, which hurt our morale as we had worked on that solution for a while.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Functional Specifications**
 - We want to have completed the Functional Specifications soon to allow the team to work on other documents.
2. **Finish choosing an algorithm**
 - Before the end of next week, no matter what, we will have chosen an algorithm to allow us to get to work.
3. **Start working on the code**
 - We need to start working on the code early to allow us to do extensive testing, this will help us avoid issues in the long run.

## Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. Even with the absences, our team should stay strong until the end of the project. We are all optimistic.
