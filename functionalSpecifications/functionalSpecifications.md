## 5. Product Details

### 5.1. Minimum Viable Product

The following is a list of the potential different phases of our product in development. Each phase is updated depending on how fast the algorithm solve our problem and how much data it can handle.

|   **Phase**  |   **Expected Speed** | **Expected Amount of Data** | **Version**  |                     
|   :-------  |   :--------- | :--------- |  :-------------  |

|   **Phase 2**  |   Less than 5 seconds | Around 300 KB |  0.2 |
|   **Phase 3**  |   Less than 5 seconds | Around 650 KB |  0.4 (Alpha) |
|   **Phase 4**  |   Less than 2 seconds | Around 300 KB |  0.6 |
|   **Phase 5**  |   Less than 2 seconds | Around 650 KB |  0.8 (Beta) |
|   **Phase 6**  |   Less than 1 second | Around 300 KB |  0.9|
|   **Phase 7**  |   Less than 1 second | Around 650 KB |  1.0 (Final) |

What our app should look like and how the user would interact with it.

### 6.4. Implementation

What we plan to implement our algorithm within our API.

### 6.5. Prototype

Link to a working prototype of our product.

## 7. Testing Strategy

The strategy listing what kind of tests must be performed for checking our algorithm.
